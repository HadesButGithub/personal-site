    <p>
        one of my personal favourite videos (criminally underrated imo), this video covers Raycast, one of the best spotlight replacement/productivity apps for macOS.
        this video is a showcase of Raycast, but is also a great showcase of some of my video editing skills. this is one of the best videos i've made on my channel.

    <p>
        40degree Studios is my secondary youtube channel, where i upload miscellaneous video projects i've created. currently, the channel may as well be dead, but
        it provides some excellent insight into what i am capable of when it comes to video editing.

    <p>
        @hadesbutig was my instagram account for the photos i'd taken, but i'm currently locked out with no way of getting back in. i'm looking into new solutions
        for uploading my content, but this account has some cool photos in the meantime.
